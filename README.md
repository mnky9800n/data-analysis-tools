# python-data-anaylsis-tools
A collection of methods, classes, etc. that I have written to make plotting easier.

### Plotting

1. Matrix plot of correlation values colored by value
2. Add jitter to data set
3. Output RGB values to txt file for matplotlib color map (useful for MATLAB, etc.)
4. School Colors data storage class

### IPython notebooks

IPython notebooks in this data set can be viewed using these links:

1. [Plotting two data sets in the same scatter matrix](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/mnky9800n/python-data-analysis-tools/blob/master/ipython-notebooks/Combining%20Two%20Scatter%20Matrices.ipynb)

### Stats

1. Confidence Interval for Likert scale survey questions.

### Other stuff

1. Performance timing in python
2. find index of maximum value in array (although I think there is a better numpy way to do this)

### SQL

1. Date Range
2. Convert epoch time to human readable datetime
