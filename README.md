# python-data-anaylsis-tools
A collection of stuff that I have written to make science easier.

### Plotting

1. Matrix plot of correlation values colored by value
2. Add jitter to data set
3. Output RGB values to txt file for matplotlib color map (useful for MATLAB, etc.)
4. School Colors data storage class

### IPython notebooks

IPython notebooks in this data set can be viewed using these links:

1. Plotting two data sets in the same scatter matrix
2. PDFs and CDFs
3. fluid flow animation
4. pcolormesh demo
5. an incredibly simple multiprocessing demonstration
6. Velociraptors

### Stats

1. Confidence Interval for Likert scale survey questions.
2. median absolute deviation

### Other stuff

1. Performance timing in python (don't use this, %timeit exists)
2. find index of maximum value in array (although I think there is a better numpy way to do this)

### SQL

1. Date Range
2. Convert epoch time to human readable datetime
