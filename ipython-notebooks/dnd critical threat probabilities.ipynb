    "# Scraping monsters and anticipating ACs to estimate critical threat probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "In d&d 3.5e, rolling a \"critical\" is an exciting event. You get to do extra damage to the monsters you are fighting and everyone always is rather excited to roll high when it happens. While the traditional critical happens when you roll 20 on the 20 sided die, some weapons have a larger range. Calculating the probability of rolling a number in this range is fairly straightforward:\n",
    "\n",
    "| critical threat range | probability |\n",
    "|-----------------------|-------------|\n",
    "| 20                    | 0.05        |\n",
    "| 19-20                 | 0.10        |\n",
    "| 18-20                 | 0.15        |\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, the more sides of a die, the more increments of 0.05 you get in probability. While this step is straightforward, actually succeeding and thus causing critical damage is more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "After your first successful critical roll you must again roll against the [Armor Class (AC)](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm) of the creature you are attacking. This produces an unknown since we typically do not know the AC of the creature we are attacking (the information is hidden by the dungeon master). Thus it becomes difficult to antipate the probability of successfully checking your critical. This notebook stands to provide some insight into these probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. scrape all the stats of monsters on the [d&d 3.5e SRD](https://d20srd.org)\n",
    "2. Calculate the average/distribution of ACs of monsters that sum to appropriate [encounter levels](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/intro.htm#challengeRating) for parties level 1-20\n",
    "3. Calculate the probabilities of critical threats based on different critical threat ranges for each party level based on the established distribution of ACs\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Encounter Levels?\n",
    "\n",
    "Encounter levels are an inaccurate measurement of how difficult a battle will be for a party of level X. A 4th level party (i.e., all the party members are level 4 characters) fighting a battle of Encounter level 4 should have a reasonable amount of difficulty in the encounter. Greater than 4 its more difficult, less than 4 it is more easy. I say this is \"inaccurate\" because ultimately there are many things that go into whether an encounter is difficult or easy (feats and abilities, magic items the party possesses, etc.). But basically, it's all we got to generate a list of monsters suitable to fight a specific party. To generate an encounter level we sum the challenge ratings of the monsters the party is fighting. So if a zombie has a Challenge rating  of 1/2 and we have a level 4 party, they should fight 8 zombies to provide an adequate challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Currently, if there is more than one table describing a monster in the monster description, only the first table is included, this will probably bias the monster statistics negatively since it typically shows the least powerful monster first"

For a 20 sided die, to roll any one side the probability is 1/20. Thus for a longsword whose critical threat range is 19-20 then the probability to threaten is 1/10.

    "\n",
    "The process to create this plot is hopefully evident from the code itself, however, I will break it down here.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data from [d20SRD monster database](http://www.d20srd.org/indexes/monsters.htm) was scraped and processed to produce a collection of armor classes\n",
    "2. Using the challenge ratings of the creatures, we calculuate encounter levels of 1000 separate encounters and put them into a dataframe for encounter levels 1 through 20\n",
    "3. This allows us to produce average ACs to calculate the second probability of success\n",
    "4. Calculating the joint probability of successfully rolling a critical ( P(roll within critical threat range) * P(succeeding against average AC) )\n",
    "5. Plot is produced\n",
    "\n",
    "# What results can we derive from this analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, the best way to increase your chances of rolling a successful critical is by increasing the critical threat range of your weapon. It's also apparent that successfully rolling a critical strike is much smaller than the probability of simply rolling in the critical threat range and the only way to increase this is to increase the attack ability modifier. To increase the critical threat range you have several options.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do this by using the [keen spell](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/keenEdge.htm), by taking the feat [Improved Critical](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#improvedCritical), or by using a magical weapon with the [keen ability](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/magicWeapons.htm#keen). Unfortunately none of these stack so all things being equal, the best choice is to take Improved Critical (which requires a base attack bonus of +8).\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond using weapons with magical damage, increasing your ability to successfully roll critical threats is good way to deal more damage. Additionally, the more times you get to roll, the higher the likelihood that you will successfully roll a critical threat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, this shows that [vorpal weapons](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/magicWeapons.htm#vorpal) are basically useless because they require a natural 20 thus the maximum joint probability can never be much more than 5% (see the black line in the plot above). Thus the likelihood of a vorpal weapon striking true (and thus instantly killing an enemy by severing their head) is less than 1 in 20 attacks. This makes increasing your critical threat range even more enticing (compared to a vorpal sword) because of the [massive damage rules](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/injuryandDeath.htm#massiveDamage). By maximizing critical damage you make it more likely to deal at least 50 points of damage in a single hit. I will add later the probability of doing 50 points of damage or more later.\n",
